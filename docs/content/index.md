# EasyBar

[![EasyBar screenshot](assets/bar.png)](assets/bar.png)

EasyBar is a lightweight, scriptable macOS status bar built with SwiftUI and Lua.

Use native built-ins for common system data such as spaces, battery, Wi-Fi, calendar, time, date, and volume. Add Lua widgets only when you need custom display logic, shell-command integration, or personal workflow behavior.

EasyBar is designed for a clean macOS workflow and integrates especially well with AeroSpace. EasyBar requires AeroSpace 0.21.0 or newer for AeroSpace-backed widgets.

## Start here

New users should follow the user path first:

1. [Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md): install EasyBar, start the services, verify that the bar responds, and optionally create a custom config.
2. [Built-ins Vs Lua](getting-started/builtins-vs-lua.md): choose whether a widget belongs in `config.toml` or in a Lua file.
3. [Configuration Overview](configuration/overview.md): learn where config lives and which pages explain each config area.
4. [Lua Widgets](lua/overview.md): add custom widgets after the built-ins cover the basics.
5. [Troubleshooting](runtime/troubleshooting.md): fix startup, service, config, permission, and runtime issues.

If you are changing EasyBar itself, start with [Internals](internals/overview.md) instead. Contributor and architecture notes are intentionally kept out of the first-run path.

## Features

- Native macOS bar window built with SwiftUI
- Configurable native widgets for spaces, applications, system status, calendar, and more
- Object-style Lua widgets with events, timers, asynchronous commands, popups, and groups
- Native right-click context menus for Lua widgets
- Shared native inbox with unread state, grouping, persistence, Markdown, and publisher actions
- File-based themes with bundled and custom TOML palettes
- AeroSpace integration for spaces, focused app state, and layout mode state
- Calendar and network helper agents for permission-sensitive data
- Persistent menu bar controller and CLI commands for reloads, restarts, and diagnostics
- Homebrew cask installation into `/Applications` with separate permission-agent services
- Config-driven logging, troubleshooting diagnostics, and lightweight runtime metrics

## How EasyBar is meant to be used

Start with the native built-ins because they keep platform-sensitive behavior in Swift and require less maintenance. Use `config.toml` for placement, grouping, themes, and built-in behavior. Reach for Lua when a widget needs custom formatting, shell commands, custom interactions, or project-specific status.

For architecture, process boundaries, agent protocols, Lua runtime internals, and contributor notes, use [Internals](internals/overview.md).

## Screenshots

### Calendar

The native [Calendar widget](configuration/builtins/calendar.md) can open a full month view from its
time and date anchor. Days with events are marked for quick scanning.

### Upcoming

The Calendar widget can also show upcoming events in a compact agenda, including their calendar,
time, and location.

### Inbox

The native [Inbox](configuration/builtins/inbox.md) collects notifications from Lua sources and the
`easybar inbox` CLI. It can group them by source or category, and items may expose actions such as
opening, dismissing, or marking them as read.

### CPU

The CPU popup shows current processor activity and a short usage history. Its context menu provides
controls for the refresh interval and history.

### Wi-Fi

The native [Wi-Fi widget](configuration/builtins/wifi.md) can display connection and network details
such as the SSID, signal strength, and IP addresses.

### Tailscale

The Lua [Tailscale widget](https://github.com/gi8lino/easybar/blob/main/widgets/tailscale.lua)
shows whether Tailscale is running and which exit node is active. Left-click the widget to start or
stop Tailscale. Right-click it to select or disable an exit node, or to refresh the current status.

#### Enabled with an exit node

#### Disabled

### Spaces

The native [Spaces widget](configuration/builtins/spaces.md) displays AeroSpace workspaces and
highlights the currently focused workspace. This example shows the widget without Front App.

### Spaces with Front App

When front-app display is enabled, the Spaces widget adds the focused application's icon and name
beside the workspace buttons. The screenshot uses these layout settings:

```toml
[builtins.spaces.layout]
hide_empty = false # Hides spaces that have no apps.
show_label = true  # Shows the workspace label.
show_icons = false # Shows app icons inside each space pill.
```

### Native widget controls

Right-click empty space in the bar to open EasyBar's context menu. The **Native Widgets** submenu
lets you enable or disable built-in widgets without editing the configuration file manually.

### Custom context menu

Lua widgets can build custom context menus with nested actions, toggles, disabled entries, and
keyboard shortcuts.

### Top bar app context menu

Right-clicking an application in the top bar opens controls for focusing, hiding, or quitting that
application without leaving the current workspace.
