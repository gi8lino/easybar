# Built-ins

EasyBar supports native built-in widgets in `config.toml`.

Built-ins are configured under `[builtins.*]`.

If you are deciding whether to use a built-in or write a Lua widget, start with [Built-ins Vs Lua](../getting-started/builtins-vs-lua.md).

Example:

```toml
[builtins.spaces]
enabled = true

[builtins.battery]
enabled = true

[builtins.wifi]
enabled = true

[builtins.calendar]
enabled = true
```

## Theme defaults

Built-ins receive visual defaults from the selected theme.

For example, a theme can provide default colors for:

- text
- surfaces
- borders
- status colors
- popup backgrounds
- active and inactive states

Explicit built-in config still wins.

Example:

```toml
[theme]
name = "default"

[builtins.time.style]
text_color = "#ffffff"
background_color = "#090909"
```

Here the time widget uses the explicit colors instead of the theme defaults.

See [Themes](themes.md).

## Groups

Built-ins can be attached to native groups:

```toml
[builtins.groups.system]
position = "right"
order = 40

[builtins.groups.system.style]

[builtins.battery]
enabled = true
group = "system"

[builtins.wifi]
enabled = true
group = "system"
```

See [Native Groups](native-groups.md).

## Box model

Built-in widgets and native groups share common layout keys:

- `margin_x`
- `margin_y`
- `padding_x`
- `padding_y`
- `spacing`

See [Box Model](box-model.md).

## Detailed guides

The generated [Configuration Reference](reference.md) lists every key and default. These guides explain behavior and interactions for the more complex built-ins:

| Built-in | Guide                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Spaces   | [Spaces](builtins/spaces.md)     |
| Inbox    | [Inbox](builtins/inbox.md)       |
| Wi-Fi    | [Wi-Fi](builtins/wifi.md)        |
| Calendar | [Calendar](builtins/calendar.md) |

The battery anchor context menu changes its display mode or color mode and writes the selection to
`config.toml` immediately. Native context-menu persistence preserves comments, whitespace, and
unrelated settings.

## Enable or disable widgets from the bar

Open **Native Widgets** from the menu bar icon or by right-clicking an empty area of the bar to
enable or disable any top-level built-in widget. Checked items are enabled. Each selection
immediately updates the corresponding `builtins.<widget>.enabled` value in `config.toml` and reloads
the bar, while preserving comments, whitespace, and unrelated settings.

Every visible native widget also has a right-click context menu with **Reload Widget** and
**Disable Widget**. Disabling is written to the active config file immediately; use **Native
Widgets** from the bar or controller menu to enable it again. Widgets with interactive settings add
their own controls above these common actions.

## When to switch to Lua

Stay with built-ins when the widget already exists and you mainly need native placement, grouping, theming, or styling.

Switch to Lua when you need:

- custom formatting or composed content
- custom mouse behavior
- popup content driven by your own data
- shell-command integration or app-specific logic

See [Lua Widgets](../lua/overview.md).
