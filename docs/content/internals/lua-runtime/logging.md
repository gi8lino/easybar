# Lua Runtime Logging

Lua logs go to stderr.

Only the structured runtime protocol moved to the dedicated Lua socket.

## Structured format

```text
EASYBAR_LUA_LOG\t<level>\t<context>\tmessage
```

## Public Lua log levels

Valid public Lua log levels are:

- `easybar.level.trace`
- `easybar.level.debug`
- `easybar.level.info`
- `easybar.level.warn`
- `easybar.level.error`

These resolve to the lowercase scripting values used by `easybar.log(...)`.

## Examples

```lua
easybar.log(easybar.level.info, "refreshing widget")
easybar.log(easybar.level.debug, "current value", 42)
easybar.log(easybar.level.trace, "raw payload", payload)
```

## Prefixed widget logs

`easybar.log.with_prefix(prefix)` returns a widget-local callable logger that prepends the prefix before forwarding to the normal host logger. It does not mutate global logging state for the widget file.

```lua
local log = easybar.log.with_prefix("[brew_outdated]")
log(easybar.level.debug, "checking outdated packages")
```

## File-backed widget logs

`easybar.log.with_file(file_name, options?)` returns a widget-local logger that remains callable like `easybar.log(...)` and can also append raw text to a widget log file.

Widget log files are constrained to the configured EasyBar log directory and accept only plain file names. This keeps the Lua API useful for long-running command widgets without exposing arbitrary file-writing paths.

Example:

```lua
local log = easybar.log.with_file("brew-widget.log", {
    prefix = "[brew_outdated]",
})

log(easybar.level.debug, "update started")
log.append(output)
local tail = log.tail(80)
```

`LuaLogBridge.swift` is the translation boundary that maps Lua log levels into the Swift host logger.

That means:

- Lua widgets should log using the public Lua API values.
- Swift remains the canonical implementation of filtering and output behavior.
