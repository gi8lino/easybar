# Network Agent

`easybar-network-agent` owns Wi-Fi and network observation.

It is responsible for:

- location permission handling
- Wi-Fi observation
- primary interface tracking
- RSSI smoothing
- field-based responses

## Key design

Unlike the calendar agent, the network agent is field-based, not snapshot-based.

Clients request only what they need.

## Request

```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "fields": ["wifi.ssid", "network.primary_interface_is_tunnel"]
}
```

## Response

```json
{
  "kind": "fields",
  "fields": {
    "wifi.ssid": "Office Wi-Fi",
    "network.primary_interface_is_tunnel": false
  },
  "fieldStatuses": {
    "wifi.ssid": "available",
    "network.primary_interface_is_tunnel": "available"
  }
}
```

## Field model

The network agent returns a flat map of typed values:

```json
{
  "wifi.ssid": "Office Wi-Fi",
  "wifi.rssi": -64,
  "network.primary_interface_is_tunnel": true
}
```

Keys are dot-separated.
Values are typed, not stringified UI values. Every requested field in a successful
`fields` response also receives one `fieldStatuses` entry: `available`,
`permission_denied`, or `unavailable`. A permission error may include statuses for the
protected fields that caused the request to fail. This lets a client distinguish an
absent live value from a field intentionally withheld by the location-privacy policy.

This is different from Lua events, where values are structured into objects.

## Field categories

### Wi-Fi fields

Wi-Fi fields describe CoreWLAN state.

Common Wi-Fi fields include:

- `wifi.ssid`
- `wifi.bssid`
- `wifi.interface`
- `wifi.hardware_address`
- `wifi.power`
- `wifi.service_active`
- `wifi.rssi`
- `wifi.noise`
- `wifi.snr`
- `wifi.link_quality`
- `wifi.tx_rate`
- `wifi.channel`
- `wifi.channel_band`
- `wifi.channel_width`
- `wifi.security`
- `wifi.phy_mode`
- `wifi.interface_mode`
- `wifi.country_code`
- `wifi.roaming`
- `wifi.ssid_changed_at`
- `wifi.interface_changed_at`

These fields are permission-sensitive on macOS because Wi-Fi identification depends on Location Services permission.

### Network fields

Network fields describe the current routing and primary interface state.

Common network fields include:

- `network.primary_interface`
- `network.primary_interface_is_tunnel`
- `network.active_tunnel_interface`
- `network.active_tunnel_interfaces`
- `network.ipv4_address`
- `network.ipv6_address`
- `network.default_gateway`
- `network.dns_servers`
- `network.route_reachable`
- `network.route_unavailable_with_local_address`
- `network.internet_reachable` (compatibility alias for route reachability)
- `network.captive_portal` (unavailable until a real portal probe supplies a result)

`network.route_reachable` is a SystemConfiguration route fact. It does not claim that
DNS, remote packets, or the public Internet are usable. An offline LAN is represented
by `network.route_unavailable_with_local_address`; it is not labeled as a captive
portal.

The built-in Wi-Fi widget can render `network.ipv4_address` and `network.ipv6_address` in inline and details views. They are network fields, not CoreWLAN fields.

### Auth fields

Auth fields describe permission state:

- `auth.location_authorized`
- `auth.location_permission_state`

## Selectors

Clients can request individual fields or namespace selectors.

Examples:

```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "fields": ["wifi.ssid", "network.ipv4_address"]
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "fields": ["wifi.*"]
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "fields": ["network.*"]
}
```

```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "fields": ["all"]
}
```

Selectors are expanded by the shared protocol layer before values are fetched.

## Snapshot usage

The main EasyBar app subscribes to a stable snapshot field set for the native Wi-Fi widget.

That snapshot contains:

- authorization state
- generated timestamp
- selected Wi-Fi fields
- primary IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- primary tunnel state

The agent still returns a flat field map. EasyBar converts that field map into the typed snapshot consumed by the native widget.

## Behavior notes

- Wi-Fi fields require location permission.
- Permission denied returns an error unless unauthorized non-sensitive fields are allowed.
- Partial responses explicitly mark protected fields as `permission_denied`.
- Supported fields with no current value are marked `unavailable`.
- RSSI is smoothed only when a monitor event or polling tick updates the cached sample; reading a response does not mutate it.
- Primary IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are read from system network state. Global IPv6 is preferred over unique-local and scoped link-local addresses.
- Tunnel discovery reconciles dynamic-store services with the active system interface inventory.
- CoreWLAN enums are converted through protocol-owned raw-value tables rather than human-readable runtime descriptions.
- The agent does not map UI labels.
- The agent does not format values for presentation.
- EasyBar decides how fields are rendered.

EasyBar converts agent values into:

- native widget state
- Lua event payloads
- UI-specific labels and detail rows

## Relationship to native widgets

Agent response:

```json
{
  "network.ipv4_address": "10.0.0.91",
  "network.ipv6_address": "fd88:84dd:4eb:43ba:189a:8f88:cdb5:3a4",
  "wifi.ssid": "Office Wi-Fi"
}
```

Native Wi-Fi inline view:

```text
Office Wi-Fi | 10.0.0.91 | fd88:84dd:4eb:43ba:189a:8f88:cdb5:3a4
```

Native Wi-Fi details view:

```text
SSID:         Office Wi-Fi
IPv4 Address: 10.0.0.91
IPv6 Address: fd88:84dd:4eb:43ba:189a:8f88:cdb5:3a4
```

The native widget owns the final display layout. In inline mode, it joins enabled field values with the configured inline separator. In details mode, it renders labels and values in separate columns.

## Relationship to Lua events

Agent response:

```json
{
  "wifi.ssid": "Office Wi-Fi"
}
```

Lua event:

```json
{
  "name": "wifi_change",
  "network": {
    "interface_name": "en0"
  }
}
```

Agents return flat data.
Lua receives structured event data.
