# Editor Support

EasyBar installs a bundled LuaLS stub into:

```text
~/.local/share/easybar/easybar_api.lua
```

That installed file is the combined public stub.

If you are working on EasyBar itself, the split source files are:

- `Sources/EasyBarApp/Lua/easybar_api.base.lua`
- `Sources/EasyBarApp/Lua/easybar_api.events.lua`

Those source files are merged into the installed `easybar_api.lua` stub during generation.

## LuaLS workspace setup

If your editor uses LuaLS, add a `.luarc.json` in the workspace where you edit widgets.

That gives you:

- no `unknown global 'easybar'` warning
- hover documentation
- autocomplete for the `easybar` API
- diagnostics and autocomplete for supported node properties such as `background.border_width`, `popup.drawing`, `interval`, and `on_interval`

Suggested setup:

1. start EasyBar once so it installs `~/.local/share/easybar/easybar_api.lua`
2. add `~/.config/easybar/widgets/.luarc.json`
3. open `~/.config/easybar/widgets` or `~/.config` as your editor workspace

Example `.luarc.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua/master/setting/schema.json",
  "runtime": {
    "version": "Lua 5.4"
  },
  "workspace": {
    "library": ["~/.local/share/easybar/easybar_api.lua"]
  },
  "diagnostics": {
    "globals": ["easybar"]
  }
}
```

If your editor still only knows about the `easybar` global but not nested property tables, restart EasyBar once so it reinstalls the latest `easybar_api.lua` stub.
