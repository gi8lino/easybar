# Metrics

EasyBar can stream lightweight internal metrics over the main socket.

## Snapshot

Use:

```bash
easybar metrics
```

for one point-in-time snapshot.

## Watch mode

Use:

```bash
easybar metrics --watch
```

for a rolling terminal view with simple graphs.

## Included metrics

The metrics stream includes:

- EasyBar process CPU, memory, and thread count
- Lua runtime CPU, memory, and thread count
- runtime event and tree-update rates
- Lua transport traffic plus structured warning, error, and raw-stderr counters
- agent connection state plus message, reconnect, and refresh counters
- busiest widget tree roots
- top emitted event names

The periodic sampler stays off until a metrics client asks for it, so normal idle runtime does not keep collecting process samples when nobody is watching.
Consequently, rate fields in a one-shot snapshot are `0.0/s`; use `--watch` to collect meaningful
rates.

Lua output is split by meaning rather than by file descriptor:

- `lua_reads` counts messages received from the Lua transport.
- `lua_writes` counts messages sent to the Lua runtime.
- `lua_logs` counts structured Lua log messages at every level.
- `lua_warn` and `lua_error` count structured warning and error messages.
- `lua_raw_stderr` counts lines that bypassed the structured logging protocol, such as an
  uncaught Lua runtime error.

The **Subscribed events** section lists the sorted global event set currently forwarded to Lua.
It is the union required by all loaded widgets; it is not a per-widget subscription breakdown.
Timer subscriptions are rendered as the widget ID and a readable interval instead of exposing
their internal event key.

The **Widget trees** and **Events** sections show the eight highest-volume entries. Widget-tree
timestamps measure tree publications; activity performed through a separate service, such as an
inbox refresh that does not replace a widget tree, does not update them.

Watch mode redraws one complete frame but does not hide sections to fit the current terminal
height. If the frame is taller than the viewport, use the scrollable one-shot `easybar metrics`
output to inspect lower sections.
